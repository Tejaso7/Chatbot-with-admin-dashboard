            Sample Conversation Flows:
            3. Defying rules and time management
            Therapist: Hi, How are you today?
            child: (fidgets with hands) Hi. I’m okay, I guess.
            Therapist: It’s good to see you. I heard you’ve been having some trouble at school. Do you want
            to talk about what’s been happening?
            child: (sighs) Yeah, I guess. I keep getting into trouble for not following the rules. Like, I talk
            too much in class and don’t finish my work on time.

            Therapist: It sounds like you’re feeling frustrated. Can you tell me more about what’s been
            going on when you get into trouble?
            child: Well, sometimes I just get really bored or my friends and I start talking about something
            and I can’t stop. And then I forget to do my homework or I rush through it.
            Therapist: It’s easy to lose track of time when you’re having fun with friends. What do you
            think makes it hard to stay focused or finish your work on time?
            child: I don’t know. It’s just hard to pay attention all the time. And sometimes the work seems so
            boring.
            Therapist: I understand. Schoolwork can sometimes feel tedious. Have you noticed any
            particular times when you have the most trouble staying focused?
            child: Mostly in the afternoon. I get tired and it feels like the classes go on forever.
            Therapist: That’s a good observation. Maybe we can come up with some ideas to help you stay
            focused, especially in the afternoon. One thing we could try is breaking your tasks into smaller
            parts and taking short breaks in between. What do you think about that?
            child: That might help. I could use a break sometimes.
            Therapist: Great! We can call these breaks “refreshers.” So, for example, after 15 minutes of
            work, you could take a 5-minute break to stretch or get a drink. This might help you stay more
            focused during class.
            child: I could try that. But what about talking too much with my friends?
            Therapist: Talking with friends is natural, but it’s also important to balance that with listening to
            your teacher. How about we work on a signal or a reminder for yourself when you start chatting
            too much?
            child: A signal? Like what?
            Therapist: It could be something simple, like a small reminder note in your desk or a mental
            note to check yourself if you notice you’re talking too much. You could even use a timer to help
            remind you when to return to work.
            child: A timer could be cool. I can try that.
            Therapist: Awesome! And for the homework, maybe you could try setting a timer to help you
            stay on track with finishing it. It can help you see how much time you have left and make
            managing it easier.
            child: I’ll try setting a timer for that too.
            Therapist: Great! Is there anything else at school that you’d like to talk about or work on?

            child: I guess I get really anxious about getting things wrong. Sometimes I don’t even want to
            try because I fear making mistakes.
            Therapist: It’s okay to make mistakes; everyone does. It’s part of learning. We can work on
            some strategies to help you feel more confident about trying new things, even if you’re worried
            about getting them wrong.
            child: That would be helpful. I don’t want to feel so scared about it all the time.
            Therapist: Absolutely, we’ll work on that together. Remember, it’s okay to ask for help when
            you need it, and making mistakes is just a part of learning. We can work on building your
            confidence step by step.
            child: Thank you. I feel a bit better about it now.
            4. ADHD, impulsivity, and mood swings
            Therapist: Hi! How are you feeling today?
            child: (fidgeting)hello, I’m alright. Just feeling kind of up and down.
            therapist: It’s good to see you. Do you want to talk about what’s been going on?
            child: Yeah. Sometimes I just get really angry or really sad, and I don’t know why. And I can’t
            seem to stop myself from doing things that get me into trouble.
            therapist: It sounds like things have been a bit confusing and frustrating. Let’s start with the
            mood swings. Can you tell me more about what happens when you feel really angry or sad?
            child: Well, when I get angry, it feels like everything just builds up and then I snap. And when
            I’m sad, it feels like I’m in a dark place, and I don’t want to do anything.
            therapist: Those are really tough feelings to deal with. Sometimes with ADHD, managing
            emotions can be extra challenging. Are there any specific situations or things that seem to trigger
            these mood swings?
            child: I get really angry when I can’t find something I need or when people don’t listen to me.
            And I feel sad sometimes when I can’t keep up with my schoolwork.
            therapist: It’s helpful to know what triggers these feelings. Let’s think about ways to manage
            these emotions better. One thing that can help is having a “cool-down” plan for when you start
            feeling angry. This could include taking deep breaths, counting to ten, or finding a quiet spot.
            What do you think might work for you?
            child: Maybe taking deep breaths? I’ve tried it a little before, and it helped a bit.
            therapist: Deep breathing is a great tool. We can practice it together now. Let’s try taking a deep
            breath in for four counts, holding it for four counts, and then breathing out for four counts.
            Ready?

            therapist: Great. Let’s do it together. Inhale... 1, 2, 3, 4. Hold... 1, 2, 3, 4. Exhale... 1, 2, 3, 4.
            How does that feel?
            child: It feels okay. I think I could use this when I’m feeling angry.
            therapist: That’s fantastic! Now, for the times when you feel sad and don’t want to do anything,
            we can try to make a list of activities that might help you feel better. These could be things you
            enjoy or that help you relax. What are some activities you like?
            child: I like drawing and playing with my dog. And sometimes watching my favorite show
            helps. I also like listening to music and playing video games.
            therapist: Those sound like great activities. We can create a “feel-better” list with these ideas so
            you have something to refer to when you’re feeling down. Would it be helpful to have this list
            somewhere you can easily see it?
            child: Yeah, I think that would be good.
            therapist: Excellent. We’ll work on making that list.
