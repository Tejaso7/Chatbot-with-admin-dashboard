 1. Introduction to Fitze: A Revolution in Fitness Tracking
Fitze is more than just a fitness app—it's a fitness rewards platform designed to turn everyday physical activity into tangible rewards, promoting healthier lifestyles across the United Arab Emirates. Launched by Fit On Click, a wellness service provider founded by Neha and Ben Samuel, Fitze represents a novel approach to fitness by incentivizing users to incorporate wellness into their daily routines. The app is built on a simple yet powerful principle: motivating people to stay active by offering rewards for the steps they take throughout their day.

Whether users are walking, running, or performing other daily activities, they can convert their steps into Fitze Coins—an in-app currency that can be redeemed for exclusive offers, discounts, and even entries into large prize giveaways. With this, Fitze differentiates itself from other fitness apps by combining fitness tracking with an element of reward-based motivation, making the journey to better health fun, engaging, and, ultimately, more rewarding.

2. Fitze’s Origins and Vision: The Story Behind the App
Fitze is a product of Fit On Click, a UAE-based company founded in 2015 by Neha and Ben Samuel, a dynamic husband-wife duo with a passion for wellness and healthy living. The motivation for creating Fitze arose from a personal challenge faced by Ben Samuel: finding the time and resources to maintain a healthy lifestyle within a busy work schedule. Faced with the difficulty of accessing suitable fitness facilities, Ben was inspired to create an app that made it easier for residents in Dubai to live healthier lives without the need for a gym or dedicated fitness center.

Neha and Ben identified a gap in the market: while the UAE had plenty of fitness apps, none combined the daily physical activities people were already doing with rewards. They saw an opportunity to build a product that not only promoted fitness but also provided users with an immediate sense of gratification, making their wellness journey more exciting and sustainable. Thus, Fitze was born with a mission to break through the clutter of traditional fitness apps, offering users a more engaging and value-driven experience.

3. How Fitze Works: Tracking Steps and Earning Rewards
Fitze functions as a step-counter or pedometer, but with a twist: users are rewarded for every step they take. Here’s a breakdown of how Fitze operates:

Step Tracking: Fitze connects with existing health and

 fitness apps on a user’s phone, including Google Fit, Apple Health, Fitbit, and Garmin, to track the number of steps they take. The app doesn’t act as a pedometer on its own but relies on these third-party apps to sync step data.

Fitze Coins: For every 1,000 steps a user takes, they earn one Fitze Coin. This in-app currency is accumulated and stored in the user’s wallet, allowing them to unlock rewards. These coins are non-transferable and can only be used within the app.

Marketplace and Rewards: Users can redeem their Fitze Coins for discounts and exclusive offers from a wide range of partner brands, including those in the fitness, lifestyle, and retail sectors. These brands include names like Talabat, Noon, Under Armour, and Sun & Sand Sports, among others【7†source】【8†source】.

Challenges and Jackpots: Fitze also allows users to participate in fitness challenges and jackpot events, giving them the chance to win bigger prizes. These challenges, which may be weekly, monthly, or even annual, push users to hit specific activity goals, providing additional motivation and engagement.

Daily Coin Limits: Both free and premium (Fitze PRO) users have a daily cap on the number of Fitze Coins they can earn. Free users can earn up to 5 coins per day, while PRO users can earn up to 15【8†source】.

4. Fitze PRO: Taking the Experience to the Next Level
For users looking to enhance their experience, Fitze offers a premium subscription called Fitze PRO. Fitze PRO provides several power-ups and benefits designed to supercharge the fitness journey:

Triple Coins: PRO users can earn 3x the number of Fitze Coins for every 1,000 steps, significantly boosting their ability to accumulate rewards quickly.

Mega Jackpots: Fitze PRO subscribers have access to exclusive jackpot prize draws, which can include high-value items like cars, international trips, and other major rewards.

Exclusive Challenges: Fitze PRO also unlocks access to advanced fitness challenges, allowing users to compete for even larger rewards【9†source】.

With Fitze PRO, users gain more opportunities to maximize their physical activity while receiving greater value through coins, jackpots, and exclusive challenges. This tier caters to users who are deeply committed to their fitness journey and are looking for additional rewards and motivation.

5. Corporate Wellness Programs: Engaging Employees Through Fitness
In addition to individual users, Fitze also offers a Corporate Module, making it a valuable tool for
 
businesses interested in improving employee wellness and engagement. This feature allows companies to set up fitness challenges that encourage employees to stay active, thus promoting a culture of health and well-being within the workplace.

These corporate challenges can help boost employee morale, foster teamwork, and encourage a healthier work-life balance. Moreover, companies can track the participation and progress of employees, using the app’s metrics to incentivize healthy habits in a competitive yet supportive environment【9†source】.

The corporate wellness program reflects Fitze’s broader mission of making fitness accessible and enjoyable for all, not just on an individual level but also within community and corporate settings.

6. Fitze’s Impact on Fitness Motivation and Health Behavior
One of Fitze’s most significant contributions to the fitness app market is its ability to encourage behavior change. By converting steps into rewards, the app creates a direct incentive for users to stay active, making it more likely that they will incorporate fitness into their daily lives. Here are some ways Fitze influences health behavior:

Gamification of Fitness: By turning physical activity into a game-like experience, Fitze taps into intrinsic motivators such as competition, achievement, and gratification. Whether users are striving to reach the top of a leaderboard or aiming to unlock new rewards, the app adds a layer of fun and excitement to the fitness journey.

Immediate Rewards for Long-Term Goals: While fitness results often take time to materialize, Fitze provides users with immediate rewards in the form of coins, discounts, and offers. This instant gratification helps bridge the gap between short-term actions (taking steps) and long-term goals (improving fitness), making it easier for users to stay committed.

Community and Social Sharing: Fitze allows users to share their progress with others, creating a sense of community and mutual encouragement. This feature adds an element of accountability, as users can inspire and be inspired by their peers.

7. Fitze’s Role in Addressing UAE’s Sedentary Lifestyle
In regions like the UAE, where sedentary lifestyles and busy work schedules are common, apps like Fitze can play a crucial role in promoting physical activity. Many residents in Dubai and other urban centers struggle to find the time and resources to stay active, particularly those with demanding jobs and long commutes.

Fitze helps address this c
ha
llenge by making fitness easy, accessible, and rewarding. Since users can earn rewards simply by walking or engaging in other forms of movement throughout the day, they are more likely to stay active even in the absence of a dedicated workout routine. By rewarding everyday activities, Fitze encourages a mindset shift towards healthier living without requiring drastic changes to a user’s schedule.

8. User Experience and App Design: A Seamless and Engaging Platform
Fitze is designed with the user in mind, offering a simple, intuitive interface that seamlessly integrates with existing fitness and health apps.

Real-Time Progress Tracking: Users can view their step count and coin balance in real-time, giving them immediate feedback on their activity levels.

Reward Redemption: The app’s marketplace is easy to navigate, allowing users to quickly find and redeem rewards using their Fitze Coins.

Live Chat Support: Fitze includes a live chat feature for troubleshooting and customer service, ensuring that users can get help whenever they need it【8†source】【9†source】.

9. Challenges and Competitions: Keeping Users Engaged
One of Fitze’s standout features is its variety of challenges and competitions that keep users engaged and motivated. Whether it’s a daily steps goal or a more complex fitness challenge, users are consistently encouraged to push their limits. These challenges come in different forms:

Step Challenges: These can be individual or group-based, where users aim to meet specific step targets within a set period. Completing these challenges often unlocks special rewards or coins.

Leaderboard Competitions: Users can see how they rank against other users in terms of steps taken, adding a competitive edge that drives engagement.

Their goal was to create a platform that would make fitness accessible and enjoyable for people who might otherwise struggle to incorporate regular exercise into their daily routines. By rewarding users for simple actions like walking, Fitze incentivizes fitness in a way that feels achievable and sustainable for everyone.

Fitze’s unique approach to fitness is particularly relevant in regions like the UAE, where high levels of sedentary behavior and long working hours make it difficult for people to prioritize their health.
